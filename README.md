# go-idletime

This is a Go library for checking the system idle time. It also includes utilities for running scheduled tasks once the machine has become idle, as well as automatic context cancellation when the machine is suddenly no longer idle.

## Platform support
It currently supports MacOS and Windows. Linux support would be easy to add, but there's been no need yet. Feel free to make a contribution!
